<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<div id="pagecontent">

<h2>Build 0.1.51.0 (2007/06/19)</h2>

<h3>SQLite Version</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Imported <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/changes.html#version_3_4_0">SQLite 3.4</a>.
</ul>



<h2>Build 0.1.47.0 (2007/05/25)</h2>

<h3>SQLite Version</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Google Gears version of SQLite was imported from SQLite CVS as of 5/21/07.  This is SQLite version 3.3.17, with additional changes which can be reviewed at <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/timeline?d=20&e=2007-May-21&c=2&px=&s=3&dm=1&dt=1&a=1&m=1&w=1&t=1&x=1">SQLite Timeline</a>.  Persistent changes that Google Gears makes to SQLite are documented at  <a href="api_database.html#sqlite_changes">Local Modifications to SQLite</a>.
</ul>



<h2>Known Issues </h2>

<p><strong>LocalServer</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Stale images may be served when the content changes for a captured URL.
</ul>

<p><strong>WorkerPool</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The onmessage property is write-only.
  <li>The onmessage property must be set before sending a message (rather than receiving a message).
</ul>

<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Installation on Windows requires administrator rights.
  <li>The installer is missing user-friendly text.
  <li>Installation requires a browser restart, but users are not told this.
</ul>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Exceptions in Firefox are not instanceof nsIConsoleError. This makes them not work properly with Firebug and JS console. As a workaround, you can catch the errors and print their .message property, or override all Objects' toString() to check if there is a message property and if so, print it.
  <li>Google Gears is compatible with Google Desktop version 5.1.0705.14375 (or higher).   
</ul>
