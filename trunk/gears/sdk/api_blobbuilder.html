<h1>BlobBuilder API</h1>

<div id="pagecontent">

<p>A BlobBuilder is a helper object for creating Blobs.</p>

  </ol>



<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>A Blob is an immutable, read-only object, the same as a JavaScript string.
BlobBuilders are used to generate a Blob with new content. They are to Java's
StringBuilder as Gears Blobs are to Java's Strings.</p>


<h4>Permission</h4>

<p>The BlobBuilder API does not require user permission.</p>
