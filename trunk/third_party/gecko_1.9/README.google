Win32, Linux-i386 and OSX prerelease version of Gecko 1.9 SDK.

The win32 and linux subdirectories were downloaded from here on 21 May 2008:

       http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/nightly/latest-trunk/xulrunner-1.9pre.en-US.*.sdk.*

The osx subdirectory was incomplete. The xpidl utility was missing and the
libraries were only compiled for PPC.

To get the osx directory, we built a universal gecko SDK from scratch:

1) Copy third_party/gecko_1.9/osx/mozconfig to ~/.mozconfig (note leading period)
2) cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot co -r BRANCH mozilla/client.mk mozilla/browser/config/mozconfig mozilla/build/macosx/universal/mozconfig
  * Note: replace BRANCH with the tag of the release you want to checkout, eg
    FIREFOX_3_0b4_RELEASE.
3) make -f client.mk checkout
  * Note: I noticed that the cvs client on my mac did not work correctly with
    mozilla's cvs server. I was getting many errors attempting to move
    directories. I worked around this by checking out on a linux workstation.
4) make -f client.mk build
5) Many of the universal libraries are now available in %TOPSRCDIR%/obj-xulrunner/ppc/dist/universal/xulrunner/XUL.framework/Versions/Current
6) A universal version of libxpcomglue_s.a was created by hand using:
    lipo -create i386/dist/sdk/lib/libxpcomglue_s.a ppc/dist/sdk/lib/libxpcomglue_s.a -output libxpcomglue_s.a
7) .jar files were copied from the i386 directory (they are non-binary).
8) The bin/ directory was copied from the i386 directory (these are only used at
   build-time and do not need to work on ppc).

Steps similar to 1-4 (but perhaps without the reference to universal in
mozconfig) should be used to create a fresh copy of the SDK for all platforms
when FF3 is final.

gecko_internal can be updated by running the following from a cygwin bash prompt:
  cp `ls | xargs -I{} /usr/bin/find /cygdrive/c/firefox-3.0rc1-source/mozilla/ -name {}` ./
nsIDOMClassInfo.h will then need to be updated by removing "nsCRT::" in NS_DOMCI_EXTENSION_ENTRY_BEGIN(_class)
