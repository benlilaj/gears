Our custom configuration options are defined in pngusr.h. This was previously
called mozpngconf.h, which was copied from Mozilla and modified by Apple (hence
the webkit_* names).

Updated to 1.2.33

http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

Local Modifications:
Our custom configuration options are defined in pngusr.h.
We also added the support for GEARS_PNG_NO_READ_VERIFY_CRC.
Turned off the PNG_NO_SEQUENTIAL_READ_SUPPORTED define as the existing Skia
library relies on APIs which are disabled when this constant is defined.
Consolidated parts of the original pnguser.h file with the updated version.
The Mangling of libpng functions to webkit_XXX has been turned off for Gears
as these APIs are needed for the Skia library to link correctly.
The PNG write macros are enabled only when the CHROME_PNG_WRITE_SUPPORT define
is enabled.
