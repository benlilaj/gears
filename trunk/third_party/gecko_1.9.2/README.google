Win32, Linux-i386 and OSX versions of Gecko 1.9.2 rc2 SDK.

The win32 and linux subdirectories were built like this:

1) Download and extract http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.9.2rc1/.
2) cp -R idl include sdk/bin sdk/lib <target dir>

This os x directory is more involved because Mozilla doesn't ship universal
binaries, and relies on some *.dylib files we don't have installed on the
build machines:

1) Download and extract i386 and ppc packages from same location as above
2) cp -R idl include sdk/bin <target dir>
3) tools/universify.sh xulrunner-ppc xulrunner-i386
4) cp -R universify_output <target dir>/lib
5) cp bin/regxpcom bin/xpidl bin/xpt_dump bin/xpt_link <target dir>/bin/
6) copy all the *.dylib files from third_party/gecko_1.9.1/osx/gecko_sdk/bin into <target dir>/bin
7) Modify xpidl to refer to the local *.dylib files:
   * otool -L xpidl
   * for each library: install_name_tool -change <currentpath> @executable_path/<libfilename> xpidl

Finally, the gecko_internal/js-config.h file needed to be tweaked slightly
to work on mac:

+#if !defined(WIN32)
 #define JS_HAVE_STDINT_H 1
+#endif
