Description:
SpiderMonkey is the code-name for the Mozilla's C implementation of JavaScript.


Local Modifications:
* Spidermonkey was taken from the mozilla/js directory & placed in 
spidermonkey/js.
* NSPR was taken from mozilla/nsprpub and placed in spidermonkey/nspr.
* Removed all files & directories produced by running the following command:
find . | egrep "tools|os2|beos|test|solaris|xpconnect|liveconnect"

Modifications to SpiderMonkey:
* Ran configure & make inside js/src directory and copied out the following
autogenerated files:
   - js/src/jsautocfg.h
   - js/src/jsautokw.h
* In js/src/jsautocfg.h - Changed macros to key off preprocessor for endianness,
rather than defining statically.
* In js/src/jsotypes.h - Added conditionals around typedefs of uint32 & int32,
as those are defined by Gears as well.
* Removed js/jsd & js/fdlibm directories.

Modifications to NSPR:
* Added "#if defined(__i386__)" to nspr/pr/src/md/unix/os_Darwin_x86.s.
* Added "#if defined(__ppc__)" to nspr/pr/src/md/unix/os_Darwin_ppc.s.
* nspr/pr/include/md/_darwin.cfg was copied to 
nspr/dist/include/nspr/prcpucfg.h.
* Removed all directories under nspr/ apart from nspr/pr and nspr/dist.
