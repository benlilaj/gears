Description:
This is STLport version 5.1.4, retrieved on Jan 17th 2008. See
http://www.stlport.org

Local Modifications:

Fixed some compiler warnings.

Added support for Android.

Added #define options to allow using a subset of iostreams without
requiring STLport to be built as a library.

Changed the following files:

_alloc.h:
	Option to use simple node allocator so we don't need
	out-of-line functions built.

_cstdlib.h:
	#if out the C library functions not present on Android.

_cwchar.h:
	#if out wide character types not defined by Android headers.

_iostream.c:
	Fix warning about ambiguous expression order.

_num_put.c:
	Fix warning about ambiguous expression order.

_range_errors.c:
	Tweak #ifs to more precisely specify when not to use
	externally defined range error functions so we don't
	need out-of-lines compiled separately.

c_locale.h:
	Don't #include broken Android wchar.h. Used the BSD _Locale_*
	definitions as Android uses a BSD derived ctype.h.

char_traits.h:
	Define streamoff type for Android.

_android.h:
	Android platform configuration defines.

_gcc.h:
	Option to prevent uncaught_exception and unexpected_exception
	being out-of-lined.

_system.h:
	Added Android platform.

cstring:
	#if out missing C library functions on Android.
