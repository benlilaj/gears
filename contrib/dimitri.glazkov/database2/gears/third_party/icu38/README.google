This directory contains a small subset of the source code of ICU 3.8 for
C/C++.  Only some UTF support is included.

  - It was obtained with the following:

     svn export --native-eol LF http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/branches/jchye/trie icu38

  - Removed everything except 'source/common/utf_impl.cc' and
    'public/common/unicode/*.h'
