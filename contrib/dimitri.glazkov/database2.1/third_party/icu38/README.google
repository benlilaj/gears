This directory contains a small subset of the source code of ICU 3.8 for
C/C++.  Only some UTF support is included.

  - It was obtained with the following:

     svn export --native-eol LF http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/branches/jchye/trie icu38

  - Removed everything except 'source/common/utf_impl.cc' and
    'public/common/unicode/*.h'

Some minor changes were required for it to build on Linux:
  - In public/common/unicode/utf.h:
      "#define U_SENTINEL (-1)" is changed to "#define U_SENTINEL (~0)"
  - In public/common/unicode/umachine.h we add:
      #elif defined(LINUX)
      #   include "unicode/plinux.h"
  - We add public/common/unicode/plinux.h  It is generated as platform.h on a
    linux machine via:
      "runConfigureICU Linux"
