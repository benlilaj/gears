Glint is a simple UI and rendering framework.

It is downloaded from http://glint-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk at revision 23.

I removed following directories:
 third_party (has expat xml library, gnu tools and smart_ptr)
 tools (build scripts)
 test
 sample_apps
Also, removed Makefile and make.bat that build sample applications.

Modifications:
 changed in linux/linux.h:
 from:
  #include "glint/third_party/scoped_ptr/scoped_ptr.h"
 to:
  #include "third_party/scoped_ptr/scoped_ptr.h"
 to pick up Gears' implementation.
