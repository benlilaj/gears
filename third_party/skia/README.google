This is the skia/src and skia/include directories of a vanilla check-out of
the Skia graphics library, revision 89, performed on 2009-02-10, via
  svn checkout http://skia.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ skia-read-only
as directed by the instructions at
  http://code.google.com/p/skia/source/checkout
plus the following changes:


skia/include/core/SkUserConfig.h lines 20-42 were added to set Gears-specific
build configuration options, based on Chromium's Skia/Win32 edits visible at
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/skia/include/corecg/SkUserConfig.h


skia/src/core/SkFP.h line 44 was changed from
...0.33333333333...
to
...0.33333333333f...
in order to disambiguate the various pow(...) implementations on the Win32
build (i.e. the (float,float) version from the (double,double) version).


skia/src/images/SkImageDecoder_libjpeg.cpp lines 28-29 and
skia/src/images/SkImageDecoder_libpng.cpp line 30 were changed to add
"third_party/libjpeg/" and "third_party/libpng/" to the #include calls.


skia/src/ports/SkFontHost_mac.cpp line 70 reversed the order of the
constructor's initializers to match the order of the field declarations,
in order to fix a compiler warning.


skia/src/ports/SkFontHost_win.cpp lines 28-29 disabled CAN_USE_LOGFONT_NAME
since it causes a compile error (since Gears uses 16-bit TCHARs and presumably
Skia/Win32 is usually built with 8-bit TCHARs).


skia/src/ports/gears_skia_win_fixes.cpp implemented empty stubs for a number
of functions declared in Skia's .h files but are missing from Skia's Windows
port (which is presumably a work-in-progress).
