This is libpng from http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html, updated to
version 1.2.44 on 2010-10-05.


Local Modifications:

Our custom configuration options are defined in pngusr.h. This was previously
called mozpngconf.h, which was copied from Mozilla and modified by Apple (hence
the webkit_* names).

pngusr.h was further customized as follows:
Turned off the PNG_NO_SEQUENTIAL_READ_SUPPORTED define as the existing Skia
library relies on APIs which are disabled when this constant is defined.
Consolidated parts of the original pnguser.h file with the updated version.
The mangling of libpng functions to webkit_XXX has been turned off for Gears
as these APIs are needed for the Skia library to link correctly.
The PNG write macros are enabled only when the CHROME_PNG_WRITE_SUPPORT define
is enabled.


In png.c
An GEARS_PNG_NO_READ_VERIFY_CRC #ifdef was added to png_reset_crc (line 213)
and png_calculate_crc (line 228).

In pngrutil.c
An GEARS_PNG_NO_READ_VERIFY_CRC #ifdef was added to png_crc_error (line 210).

In pngwio.c
A "BEGIN GEARS MODIFICATION"-delimited block of code replaces fileno with
_fileno on WIN32, since the former is deprecated, according to Visual Studio.
