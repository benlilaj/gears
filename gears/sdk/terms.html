    <h3><p align="center">Terms of Service </h3>
    <p align="left"><strong>Welcome to Google!</strong></p>
    <h4>1. Your relationship with Google</h4>
    <p>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your use of Google Gears (referred to as &ldquo;Google Gears&rdquo; or &ldquo;Services&rdquo; in this document) is subject to the terms of a legal  agreement between you and Google.&nbsp; &ldquo;Google&rdquo;  means Google Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600   Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.&nbsp; This document explains how the agreement is  made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.</p>
    <p>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless otherwise agreed in writing with  Google, your agreement with Google will always include, at a minimum, the terms  and conditions set out in this document.&nbsp;  These are referred to below as the &ldquo;Terms.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Terms form a legally binding  agreement between you and Google in relation to your use of Google Gears.&nbsp; It is important that you take the time to  read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as  the &ldquo;Terms.&rdquo;</p>
    <h4>2.  Accepting  the Terms</h4>
    <p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to use Google Gears, you must  first agree to the Terms.&nbsp; You may not  use Google Gears if you do not accept the Terms.</p>
    <p>2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can accept the Terms by:</p>
    <p>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clicking to accept or agree to the Terms,  where this option is made available to you by Google in the user interface for  any Services; or </p>
    <p>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by actually using Google Gears.&nbsp; In this case, you understand and agree that Google  will treat your use of Google Gears as acceptance of the Terms from that point  onwards. </p>
    <p>2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not use Google Gears and may not accept  the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with  Google, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the  laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you  are resident or from which you use the Services.</p>
    <p>2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you continue, you should print  off or save a local copy of the Terms for your records. </p>
    <h4> 3.  Language of  the Terms</h4>
    <p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Google has provided you with a  translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that  the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English  language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Google.</p>
    <p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is any contradiction between  what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says,  then the English language version shall take precedence.</p>
    <h4> 4.  Provision of  the Services by Google</h4>
    <p>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google has subsidiaries and affiliated  legal entities around the world (&ldquo;Subsidiaries and Affiliates&rdquo;).&nbsp; Sometimes, these companies will be providing  the Services to you on behalf of Google itself. You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries  and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.</p>
    <p>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google is constantly innovating in order  to provide the best possible experience for its users.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that the form and  nature of the Services which Google provides may change from time to time  without prior notice to you.</p>
    <p>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of this continuing innovation, you  acknowledge and agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing  the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally  at Google&rsquo;s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using  the Services at any time.&nbsp; You do not  need to specifically inform Google when you stop using the Services.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that if Google  disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services,  your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.</p>
    <p>4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that while Google  may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions  you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space  used for the provision of any Services, such fixed upper limits may be set by  Google at any time, at Google&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
    <h4> 5.  Use of the Services  by you </h4>
    </h4>
    <p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to access certain Services, you  may be required to provide information about yourself (such as identification  or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Services, or as  part of your continued use of the Services.&nbsp;  You agree that any registration information you give to Google will  always be accurate, correct and up to date.</p>
    <p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree to use the Services only for purposes  that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation,  third-party terms of service, or generally accepted practices or guidelines in  the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or  software to and from the United    States or other relevant countries).</p>
    <p>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree not to access (or attempt to  access) any of the Services by any means other than through the interface that  is provided by Google, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a  separate agreement with Google.<br />
      &nbsp;<br />
      5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that you will not engage in  any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and  networks which are connected to the Services).</p>
    <p>5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that if you use Google Gears to  develop a service for other users, you will protect the privacy and legal  rights of those users.&nbsp; If the users  provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal  information, you must make the users aware that the information will be  available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy  notice and protection for those users.&nbsp;  If your application stores information submitted by users, it must do so  securely.&nbsp; If the user provides you with  Google Account information, you may only use that information to access the  user&rsquo;s Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user  has given you permission to do so.</p>
    <p>5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you have been specifically  permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Google, you agree that you will  not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any  purpose.<br />
      &nbsp; <br />
      5.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that you are solely responsible  for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any  breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including  any loss or damage which Google may suffer) of any such breach.</p>
    <h4> 6.  Your passwords  and account security </h4>
    </h4>
    <p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree and understand that you are  responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords associated with  any account you use to access the Services.</p>
    <p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, you agree that you will be  solely responsible to Google for all activities that occur under your account. </p>
    <p>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you become aware of any unauthorized  use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Google immediately.</p>
    <h4> 7.  Privacy and your personal information  </h4>
    </h4>
    <p>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For information about Google&rsquo;s data  protection practices, please read Google&rsquo;s privacy policy at <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html">http://www.google.com/privacy.html</a>.&nbsp; This policy explains how Google treats your  personal information, and protects your privacy, when you use the Services.</p>
    <p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree to the use of your data in  accordance with Google&rsquo;s privacy policies. </p>
     <h4>8.  Content in  the Services </h4>
    <p>8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You understand that all information  (such as data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or  other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have access to  as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of  the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred  to below as the &ldquo;Content.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google reserves the right (but shall  have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove  any or all Content from any Service. For some of the Services, Google may provide  tools to filter out explicit sexual content.&nbsp;  These tools include the SafeSearch preference settings (see <a href="http://www.google.com/help/customize.html#safe">http://www.google.com/help/customize.html#safe</a>).&nbsp; In addition, there are commercially available  services and software to limit access to material that you may find  objectionable.</p>
    <p>8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You understand that by using the Services  you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or  objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that you are solely responsible  for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any  Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Services and for the  consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may  suffer) by doing so.</p>
     <h4>9.  Proprietary  rights </h4>
    <p>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You  acknowledge and agree that Google (or Google&rsquo;s licensors) own all legal right,  title and interest in and to the Services, <a name="OLE_LINK2" id="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1" id="OLE_LINK1">including any  intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those  rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights  may exist).&nbsp; </a></p>
    <p>9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you have agreed otherwise in  writing with Google, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of  Google&rsquo;s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other  distinctive brand features.</p>
    <p>9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have been given an explicit right  to use any of these brand features in a separate written agreement with Google,  then you agree that your use of such features shall be in compliance with that  agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and Google's brand feature  use guidelines as updated from time to time.&nbsp;  These guidelines can be viewed online at <a href="http://www.google.com/permissions/guidelines.html">http://www.google.com/permissions/guidelines.html</a> (or such other URL as Google may provide for this purpose from time to time).</p>
    <p>9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google  acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or  your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you create, submit,  post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any  intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those  rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights  may exist).&nbsp; Unless you have agreed otherwise  in writing with Google, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and  enforcing those rights and that Google has no obligation to do so on your  behalf.</p>
    <p>9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that you shall not remove,  obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trade  mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services. </p>
    <p>9.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless you have been expressly authorized  to do so in writing by Google, you agree that in using the Services, you will not  use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization  in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized  user of such marks, names or logos.</p>
     <h4>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License  from Google </h4>
    <p>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google gives you a personal, worldwide,  royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software  provided to you by Google as part of the Services as provided to you by Google  (referred to as the &ldquo;Software&rdquo; below).&nbsp;  This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy  the benefit of the Services as provided by Google, in the manner permitted by  the Terms.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may not (and you may not permit anyone  else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile  or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software or any part  thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you  have been specifically told that you may do so by Google, in writing (<em>e.g</em>., through an open source software license). </p>
    <p>10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless Google has given you specific  written permission to do so (<em>e.g</em>.,  through an open source software license), you may not assign (or grant a sub-license  of) your rights to use the Software, grant a security interest in or over your  rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to  use the Software.</p>
    <p>10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use, reproduction and distribution of components  of the Services released under an open source software license are governed  solely by the terms of that open source software license.</p>
     <h4>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your code </h4>
    <p>11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google claims no ownership or control over  any source code written by you to be used with the Services.&nbsp; You retain copyright and any other rights you  already hold in this code, and you are responsible for protecting those rights,  as appropriate.</p>
    <p>11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that Google, in its sole  discretion, may use your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain  names and other distinctive brand features in presentations, marketing  materials, customer lists, financial reports and Web site listings (including  links to your website) for the purpose of advertising or publicizing your use  of the Services.</p>
     <h4>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software updates </h4>
    <p>12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Software which you use may  automatically download and install updates from time to time from Google.&nbsp; These updates are designed to improve,  enhance and further develop the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software  modules and completely new versions.&nbsp; You  agree to receive such updates (and permit Google to deliver these to you) as  part of your use of the Services.</p>
     <h4>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ending your  relationship with Google </h4>
    <p>13.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Terms will continue to apply until  terminated by either you or Google as set out below.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>13.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may terminate your legal agreement  with Google by discontinuing your use of the Services at any time.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>13.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google may, at any time, terminate its  legal agreement with you if:</p>
    <p>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you have breached any provision of the  Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to,  or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or</p>
    <p>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google is required to do so by law (for  example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful);  or</p>
    <p>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the partner with whom Google offered the  Services to you has terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer  the Services to you; or&nbsp; </p>
    <p>(D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google is transitioning to no longer  providing the Services to users in the country in which you are resident or  from which you use the service; or</p>
    <p>(E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the provision of the Services to you by  Google is, in Google&rsquo;s opinion, no longer commercially viable.</p>
    <p>13.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing in this Section shall affect  Google&rsquo;s rights regarding provision of Services under Section 4 of the Terms. </p>
    <p>13.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When these Terms come to an end, all of  the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Google have  benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the  Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall  be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of Sections 14, 15 and Paragraph  19.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.</p>
     <h4>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES </h4>
    <p>14.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTHING IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTIONS  14 AND 15, SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT GOOGLE&rsquo;S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES  WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp; SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION  OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY  FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF  IMPLIED TERMS, OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.&nbsp; ACCORDINGLY, ONLY THE LIMITATIONS WHICH ARE  LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND OUR LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
    <p>14.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT  YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE  PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>

    <p>14.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE  OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND  RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER  SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY  SUCH MATERIAL.</p>
    <p>14.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR  WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM GOOGLE OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES SHALL  CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE TERMS.</p>
    <p>14.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES  AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS  FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

     </p><p>    19.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that Google may provide you with  notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular  mail, or postings on the Services.
      </p><p>   19.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You  agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which  is contained in the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under any  applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google&rsquo;s  rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     </p><p>  19.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If  any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that  any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from  the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms.&nbsp; The remaining provisions of the Terms will  continue to be valid and enforceable.
     </p><p>   19.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You  acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which  Google is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such  other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any  provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them.&nbsp; Other than this, no other person or company  shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.
     </p><p>  19.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Terms, and your relationship with Google  under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without  regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to  the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara,  California to  resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you  agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an  equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
