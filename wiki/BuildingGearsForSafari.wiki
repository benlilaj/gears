#summary Building Google Gears for Safari

= Introduction =

If you've already snagged a recent !WebKit nightly [http://nightly.webkit.org build] (522 or later), then you can proceed to build Google Gears for Safari.

There are two big differences between the Firefox and IE builds:
  * The current code for Safari does not implement the !FileSubmitter class.
  * The !WorkerPool is implemented as separate processes for each Worker and uses Distributed Objects to pass messages.  The downside is that it's much slower for messaging than the implementations using platform threads

Both of these are being actively worked on.

= Building =

  # Open *gears/base/safari/project/project.xcodeproj* using Xcode.
  # Build the Release build for a Universal binary (or Debug if you want to see how it all works, but just your native CPU).

= Installing =

If you have [http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Iceberg.html Iceberg] installed:
  # Open *gears/base/safari/project/!GearsSafari.packproj*.
  # Build and run.
  # The plugin and input manager will be installed in /Library.

Otherwise, you can install the components manually:
  # Copy *gears/base/safari/project/build/Release/Gears.plugin* to the desired Library/Internet Plug-Ins folder (e.g., ~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins).
  # Copy *gears/base/safari/project/build/Release/!GoogleGearsEnabler* to the desired Library/!InputManagers folder (e.g., ~/Library/!InputManagers).

= Testing =
After installing, you should restart !WebKit.  Go to the Google Gears API [http://code.google.com/apis/gears/ page].  At the lower left corner, it should indicate the build of Google Gears that is active.  You should be able to try out the demos or create your own.
