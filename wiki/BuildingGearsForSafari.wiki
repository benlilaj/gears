#summary Building Gears for Safari

= Current Status =
Gears for Safari compiles and runs in the current repository, there are still bugs and we currently working on stabilizing the port. If you are not a developer, interested in contributing to the Safari port, it's recommended that you wait for an official release.

= Introduction =

The Safari port is implemented as an NPAPI plugin.  It currently has feature parity with other platform with the exception of the !FileSubmitter class.

= Components =

Gears for Safari is made up of two components:
  # !GearsEnabler - An Inputmanager installed in `/Library/InputManagers/` serves to load Gears at browser startup in order to activate HTTP Interception and install the 'Gears Settings...' menu item.
  # Gears.plugin - The actual NPAPI plugin, resides in `/Library/Internet Plugins/`.

= Building =
  # Type `make` in a terminal window at the root of the `gears/` directory.

= Installing =

If you have [http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Iceberg.html Iceberg] installed you will get a Gears.pkg package that you can double click to install.  Otherwise you can run the script under `tools/osx/install_gears.sh` which will install Gears for you. 

Another option is to install the components manually:
  # Copy `gears/bin-[dbg|opt]/Installers/Safari/Gears.plugin` to the `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins` folder.
  # Copy ``gears/bin-[dbg|opt]/Installers/Safari/!GearsEnabler` to /Library/!InputManagers folder.  In order to get this to work correctly on OS X 10.5, you will need to set the permissions of GearsEnabler correctly, the `tools/osx/install_inputmanager.sh` script will do this for you.

= Testing =
After installing, you should restart Safari.  Go to the [http://gears.google.com Gears Homepage], this will indicated whether Gears is installed and what version is running.  In addition you will see the 'Gears Settings...' menu item under the Safari Application menu.  If you've compiled a debug build, Gears will print diagnostic messages to the console as it loads, you can use these to diagnose problems you may have with the Gears installation.

= XCode Project =
You can find an XCode project for compiling Gears at `tools/osx/gears.xcodeproject`.  This is included mainly for convenience for Mac Developers, the "official" releases of Gears are compiled via the Makefile.

= Breakpad =
Breakpad is only enabled for official builds, it will not work correctly if the file in `/Library/Internet Plugins` is an alias to the Gears.plugin file in your build directory rather than a copy.  Also, by default, Breakpad turns itself off when running Gears under a debugger.
