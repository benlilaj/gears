#summary This API enables a script to trigger the camera viewfinder and allow a picture or video to be captured using the device's onboard camera.

= Introduction =

The goal of this API is to allow a Web application to launch the native camera application and obtain the resulting media file. 

On devices with built-in camera, all of the UI interaction is left to the corresponding native camera application, not Gears. 

On devices that do not have a built-in camera (e.g. laptop or desktop computers),  Gears will scan for attached Web cameras and will provide a basic viewport that allows the users to grab a picture or record a movie.

This API is based on the "action-driven permission model" - the user is involved in the action and hence a separate permission prompt is not required.
