# Conventions & Caveats for the Gears codebase

= Introduction =

This page documents some guidelines you should follow when writing Gears code.


= HTML UI Files =

The *TRANS_BLOCK* tag is used inside the HTML files used for the Gears UI to mark strings for translation.

  * Please try not to change the text in these blocks if not absolutely necessary as this requires sending them for retranslation.
  * Do not put HTML tags inside of <TRANS_BLOCK> tags if it can be avoided.  This adds clutter to our strings, and adds a point of failure for the UIs in localized versions of Gears.
