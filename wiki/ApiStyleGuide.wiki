= Introduction =

It's easier to use an API when it has a consistent style because you can guess how something works without thinking too hard. It's also easier to implement such APIs because  it lets you focus on your feature rather than grammar and stylist minutiae.

Let's grow this document into a set of easy to follow conventions for designing Gears APIs that are easy for developers and easy for us.


= Error Messages =

== All Errors ==

  * Start with a capital letter, and end with a period.
