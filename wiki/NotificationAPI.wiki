#summary Providing desktop notifications for web applications.

= Summary =

The Gears Notificatations APIs are responsible for managing notifications from web applications, and showing them on the user's desktop. Incoming notifications are not displayed when the user is considered not available for the notifications, i.e. the user is away, idle or in full-screen presentation mode.

Notifications are displayed in top-most balloon-styled windows. On Windows, balloons always appear starting in the lower right corner of the primary screen's working area and go upward. On Macs, they start at the upper right corner and proceed downward. The balloons are constrained to ensure that the balloons will not take up more than 75% of the height of the working area.
